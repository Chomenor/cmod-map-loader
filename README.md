This is a tool for downloading and processing maps and mods for use with ST:V Elite Force multiplayer servers running the experimental [cMod engine](https://github.com/Chomenor/cmod-engine-alpha) and [server config](https://github.com/Chomenor/cmod-server-template).

## Usage

```
git clone https://github.com/Chomenor/cmod-map-loader
python3 cmod-map-loader/run_export.py
```

If successful, directory `cmod-map-loader/output` will be created and available to use according to the instructions in the [server config](https://github.com/Chomenor/cmod-server-template).
